# DailyLens 1-Page Marketing Plan (9-Cell Matrix)

Framework reference: This plan is adapted from the 9-cell structure in *The 1-Page Marketing Plan* by Allan Dib.

## Positioning Premise
DailyLens is positioned as a decision-support discovery platform for AI Engineers and Data Scientists, not a generic content feed.

## 1) Target Market (Before)
- Primary ICP: AI Engineers and Data Scientists in startups and product teams.
- Secondary ICP: ML Engineers, MLOps Engineers, Research Engineers.
- Core pain: too much AI content, low signal-to-noise, missed important updates.
- Trigger moment: "I need to stay current in AI with limited daily time."

## 2) Message (Before)
- Core message: "DailyLens gives you a personalized AI intelligence feed that adapts to your behavior and still surfaces what you might miss."
- Outcome promise: better signal quality in ~10 minutes/day.
- Differentiation:
  - role-aware personalization,
  - recency-aware ranking,
  - controlled exploration (`strict`, `balanced`, `discovery`).

## 3) Media (Before)
- Organic channels:
  - LinkedIn posts for AI practitioners,
  - X threads summarizing weekly AI shifts,
  - technical blog posts + product demo clips.
- Community channels:
  - Reddit AI/ML communities,
  - Slack/Discord AI groups,
  - AI-focused newsletters/communities.
- Direct channels:
  - founder-led outreach to AI leaders and data teams.

## 4) Lead Capture (During)
- Landing page CTA: "Build your personalized AI feed in 2 minutes."
- Lead magnet: free AI signal briefing + starter feed.
- Capture fields:
  - role,
  - top interests,
  - current challenge,
  - optional work email.

## 5) Lead Nurture (During)
- 5-step nurture flow:
  1. quick setup and focus mode guidance,
  2. weekly "what you missed" summary,
  3. relevance proof via saved/read behavior,
  4. referral loop and discount explanation,
  5. upgrade prompt with value proof.
- In-product nudges:
  - complete onboarding,
  - set recommendation scenario,
  - save/share first article.

## 6) Sales Conversion (During)
- Packaging:
  - Free: limited posts/month + ads,
  - Silver: larger usage allowance,
  - Gold: unlimited usage.
- Conversion moments:
  - post-limit boundary,
  - repeated high-intent engagement (save/share),
  - referral discount stacking.
- Trust levers:
  - transparent feed controls,
  - clear sponsorship labeling,
  - no hidden paywall behavior.

## 7) Delivery (After)
- Aha moment target: first relevant article within first 3 recommendations.
- Product promise:
  - simple feed-first UX,
  - advanced controls in profile drawer,
  - fast interaction loop and responsive UI.
- Quality guardrail:
  - stale content suppression via recency constraints.

## 8) Retention and Upsell (After)
- Retention loops:
  - daily lightweight check-in,
  - weekly digest,
  - personalized exploration prompts.
- Upsell triggers:
  - frequent limit hits,
  - recurring use in strict/balanced modes,
  - team-level referral behaviors.
- Expansion path:
  - keep ICP-first UX while broadening taxonomy coverage over time.

## 9) Referrals and Advocacy (After)
- Existing loop:
  - referral code,
  - renewal discount tied to successful referrals.
- Next enhancements:
  - shareable "Weekly AI Radar" cards,
  - team invite flow with tier credits,
  - lightweight case studies from practitioner users.

## Competitor Context and Strategic Response

### Competitor categories
- Newsletters: strong curation, weak personalization.
- Blogging platforms (Medium/Substack blogs): depth but low prioritization for the individual user.
- General mobile feeds/aggregators: high volume, low professional intent.

### DailyLens strategic response
- Compete on "decision utility per minute," not content volume.
- Measure and communicate:
  - time-to-first-useful-article,
  - save/share rate,
  - weekly return and retention.
- Build moat through:
  - personalization quality,
  - trust and transparency,
  - user habit loops.

## Core KPI Stack (for this plan)
- Acquisition: landing conversion, signup completion rate.
- Activation: first interaction rate, first save/share rate.
- Retention: D7/D30, weekly active readers.
- Revenue: free->paid conversion, ARPU by tier.
- Referral: referral send rate, referral signup rate, discount redemption.

## 30-Day Execution Sequence
1. Week 1: ship ICP landing page copy and lead capture form.
2. Week 2: launch nurture flow and weekly AI signal digest.
3. Week 3: run channel experiments (LinkedIn, communities, founder outreach).
4. Week 4: optimize upgrade prompts and referral conversion funnel.
