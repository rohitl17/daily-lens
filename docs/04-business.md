# Business and Monetization Specification

## Monetization Model
Hybrid approach:
- Subscription tiers
- Ad-supported free plan

## GTM Positioning
- Near-term: AI Engineers and Data Scientists as primary acquisition focus.
- Expansion path: preserve cross-domain content graph so the same platform can serve broader professional segments later.
- Product lever: focus-mode controls keep immediate ICP value high while proving heterogeneous-customer scalability.

## Current Tiering (Simulated)
- Free: 5 posts/month + ads
- Silver: 50 posts/month
- Gold: Unlimited

## Revenue Levers
- Subscription conversion from free to silver/gold
- Ad revenue from sponsored inventory on free users
- Retention improvement through recommendation quality

## Unit Economics (Framework)
Track:
- CAC (if paid growth)
- ARPU by tier
- Gross margin (infra + content + support)
- LTV/CAC
- Ad RPM for free users

## KPI Dashboard (Business)
- Free -> paid conversion rate
- Paid retention (M1, M3)
- Post-limit upgrade attempts/conversion
- Ad CTR and ad-induced churn impact

## Pricing Risks
- Free limit may be too restrictive for activation
- Silver value may be unclear without feature differentiation
- Ads can damage trust if poorly labeled or over-served

## Recommended Packaging Next
- Free: increase allowance or daily cap
- Silver: add meaningful product benefits (alerts, saves, digest)
- Gold: ad-free + advanced controls + premium discovery features

## Experiment Plan
- A/B free limit values
- A/B ad density and placement
- A/B upgrade prompts at limit boundary
