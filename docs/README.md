# DailyLens Documentation Hub

This folder organizes the project for Product, Design, Engineering, and Business teams.

## Start Here

- `docs/00-exec-summary.md`: leadership summary, ROI, value proposition, differentiation
- `docs/01-product.md`: product strategy, personas, user journeys, KPIs
- `docs/02-design.md`: UX architecture, interaction model, responsive behavior
- `docs/03-engineering.md`: current system, APIs, data model, technical constraints
- `docs/04-business.md`: monetization model, pricing, ads strategy, business KPIs
- `docs/05-scaling-roadmap.md`: v1 -> v2 -> v3 plan toward 1M DAU
- `docs/06-operating-model.md`: ownership model, rituals, release and experiment process
- `docs/07-marketing-plan.md`: 1-page marketing plan (9-cell matrix) for GTM execution

## Current State Summary

- Current app is a strong prototype and product demo.
- It is **not yet production-scalable** for 1M DAU.
- Core risks today: local single-node deployments, limited durability in memory mode, no distributed caching, and no fully managed production event pipeline.

## How to Use This Hub

1. Leadership starts with `00` for strategy + ROI framing.
2. Product/Design use `01` and `02` to align roadmap and UX.
3. Engineering uses `03` and `05` to drive implementation priorities.
4. Business/GTM uses `04` to evaluate pricing, conversion, and ad strategy.
5. Leadership uses `05` + `06` for sequencing, staffing, and execution governance.
